BARTON: Okay, hold on,
don't shoot.

3
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:12.334
- You see where you're going?
- Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:13.268
Okay.

5
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.406
Now, let's worry
about how you get there.

6
00:00:16.106 --> 00:00:18.040
Gotta move
your foot here.

7
00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:19.843
Point your toe this way.

8
00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:21.643
Your hips here.

9
00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:23.113
Okay?

10
00:00:23.747 --> 00:00:25.180
- Can you see?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:25.182 --> 00:00:26.315
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

12
00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:27.850
How about now?
Can you see now?

13
00:00:27.852 --> 00:00:29.384
- (CHUCKLES) No.
- How about now?

(BOTH LAUGH)

15
00:00:31.455 --> 00:00:32.523
All right.

19
00:00:40.164 --> 00:00:41.530
COOPER: Here you go.

20
00:00:41.532 --> 00:00:43.899
Hey, you guys
want mayo? Or mustard?

21
00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:45.701
Or both?

22
00:00:45.703 --> 00:00:47.803
Who puts mayo
on a hot dog?

23
00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:48.904
Probably your brothers.

24
00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:51.038
Uh, two mustard, please!
Thanks, Mama.

25
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.608
LAURA: Got it!

26
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.244
Nate, mayo or mustard?

27
00:00:54.812 --> 00:00:56.310
How about ketchup?

28
00:00:56.312 --> 00:00:58.714
LAURA: Or ketchup.
I got ketchup, too.

29
00:00:58.716 --> 00:00:59.783
BARTON: Mind your elbow.

30
00:01:01.852 --> 00:01:03.952
(LAUGHS)
Good job, hawk-eye.

31
00:01:03.954 --> 00:01:06.724
Go get your arrow.

LAURA: Hey, guys!

33
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.460
Enough practice.
Soup's on!

34
00:01:12.462 --> 00:01:13.427
BARTON: All right.

35
00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:15.064
We're coming.
We're hungry.

36

You don't need
to do that.

49
00:02:39.414 --> 00:02:42.350
Because, uh, you're just
holding the position.

50
00:02:43.184 --> 00:02:44.751
- Oh, yeah.
- (GRUNTS)

51
00:02:44.753 --> 00:02:47.454
- That was close.
- (GRUNTS)

52
00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:49.388
That's a goal.
We are now one apiece.

53
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.892
I would like to try again.

54
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.795
We're tied up.
Feel the tension?

55
00:02:55.797 --> 00:02:57.363
It's fun.

56
00:02:57.365 --> 00:02:59.567
That was terrible.
Now you have a chance to win.

57
00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:01.770
And you've won.

58

Congratulations.

00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:05.406
Fair game.

Good sport.

00:03:08.977 --> 00:03:10.478
You have fun?

62
00:03:12.146 --> 00:03:14.281

If you find this recording...

don't post it on social media.

grovel for a couple weeks...

with enormous guilt...

any coordinates, anything?

I had a vision.
I didn't wanna believe it.

Thought I was dreaming.

Tony, I'm gonna
need you to focus.

That trumps what you need.
It's too late, buddy.

Sorry.

that what we needed

166
00:11:19.758 --> 00:11:21.725

I can tell you
where Thanos is.

210
00:12:56.186 --> 00:12:59.854
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

211
00:12:59.856 --> 00:13:04.025
And when he worked,
he talked about his Great Plan.

212
00:13:04.027 --> 00:13:07.429
Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

213
00:13:07.431 --> 00:13:09.197
I'd ask...

214
00:13:09.199 --> 00:13:12.534
where would we go
once his plan was complete?

215
00:13:12.536 --> 00:13:14.738
And his answer
was always the same.

216
00:13:18.709 --> 00:13:20.242
"To the Garden."

217
00:13:20.244 --> 00:13:23.345
That's cute.
Thanos has a retirement plan.

218
00:13:23.347 --> 00:13:25.013
So, where is he?

219
00:13:25.015 --> 00:13:27.249
When Thanos snapped
his fingers...

220
00:13:27.251 --> 00:13:29.517
Earth became ground zero
for a power surge

00:32:15.492 --> 00:32:17.024
What if there was a way...

491
00:32:17.026 --> 00:32:18.793
that we could enter
the quantum realm

492
00:32:18.795 --> 00:32:19.993
at a certain point in time...

493
00:32:19.995 --> 00:32:21.629
but then exit
the quantum realm

494
00:32:21.631 --> 00:32:22.896
at another point in time?

495
00:32:22.898 --> 00:32:24.965
Like...

496
00:32:24.967 --> 00:32:27.167
- Like before Thanos.
- STEVE: Wait.

497
00:32:27.169 --> 00:32:28.969
Are you talking
about a time machine?

498
00:32:28.971 --> 00:32:31.905
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

499
00:32:31.907 --> 00:32:33.142
This is more like a...

500
00:32:35.244 --> 00:32:37.044
Yeah. Like a time machine.

501
00:32:37.046 --> 00:32:38.946
I know, it's crazy.
It's crazy.

502
00:32:38.948 --> 00:32:41.315
(STAMMERS) But I can't stop
thinking about it.

503
00:32:41.317 --> 00:32:42.518
There's gotta be...

504
00:32:43.119 --> 00:32:44.685
some way... (SIGHS)

505
00:32:44.687 --> 00:32:46.653
- It's crazy.
- NATASHA: Scott.

506
00:32:46.655 --> 00:32:48.021
I get emails from a raccoon...

507
00:32:48.023 --> 00:32:50.824
so nothing sounds crazy
anymore.

508
00:32:50.826 --> 00:32:53.095
So, who do we talk to
about this?

509
00:33:11.313 --> 00:33:12.381
Chow time!

510
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:15.984
Maguna.

511
00:33:20.021 --> 00:33:21.524
Morgan H. Stark,
you want some lunch?

512
00:33:22.558 --> 00:33:23.624
<i>Define "lunch"</i>

513
00:33:23.626 --> 00:33:25.026
- <i>or be disintegrated.</i>
- Okay.

514
00:33:26.127 --> 00:33:27.828
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

515
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:29.395
That is part of a special
anniversary gift

516
00:33:29.397 --> 00:33:30.465
I'm making for Mom.

517
00:33:34.068 --> 00:33:36.670
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

518
00:33:36.672 --> 00:33:38.938
I can give you a handful of
crickets on a bed of lettuce.

519
00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.841
- No.
- That's what you want.

520
00:33:40.843 --> 00:33:43.075
How did you find this?

521
00:33:43.077 --> 00:33:45.077
- Garage.
- Really?

522
00:33:45.079 --> 00:33:47.282
- Were you looking for it?
- No.

523
00:33:47.982 --> 00:33:50.016
- I found it, though.
- Hmm.

524
00:33:50.018 --> 00:33:51.951
You like going in
the garage, huh?

525
00:33:51.953 --> 00:33:53.753
So does Daddy. (GRUNTS)

526
00:33:53.755 --> 00:33:57.024
It's fine, actually.
Mom never wears anything I buy her.

527
00:33:59.594 --> 00:34:00.994
So, I'm gonna...

528
00:34:18.212 --> 00:34:20.913
(STAMMERS) No. We know
what it sounds like.

529
00:34:20.915 --> 00:34:22.013
Tony, after everything
you've seen,

530
00:34:22.015 --> 00:34:23.315
is anything really
impossible?

531
00:34:23.317 --> 00:34:25.383
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale...

532
00:34:25.385 --> 00:34:27.185
which then triggers
the Deutsch Proposition.

533
00:34:27.187 --> 00:34:28.553
Can we agree on that?

534
00:34:28.555 --> 00:34:29.722
Thank you.

535
00:34:29.724 --> 00:34:32.123
In layman's terms,
it means you're not coming home.

536
00:34:32.125 --> 00:34:33.458
- I did.
- No.

537
00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.427
You accidentally survived.
(SIGHS)

538
00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:37.696
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

539
00:34:37.698 --> 00:34:41.168
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

540
00:34:43.003 --> 00:34:44.402
A time heist?

541
00:34:44.404 --> 00:34:46.771
Yeah, a time heist.
Of course.

542
00:34:46.773 --> 00:34:48.073
Why didn't we think
of this before?

543
00:34:48.075 --> 00:34:50.709
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

544
00:34:50.711 --> 00:34:52.911
The stones are in the past.

545
00:34:52.913 --> 00:34:54.312
We could go back,
we could get them.

546
00:34:54.314 --> 00:34:56.681
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

547
00:34:56.683 --> 00:34:58.950
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

548
00:34:58.952 --> 00:35:00.418
I don't believe we would.

549
00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.955
Gotta say it. I sometimes
miss that giddy optimism.

550
00:35:03.957 --> 00:35:05.857
However, high hopes
won't help...

551
00:35:05.859 --> 00:35:07.893
if there's no logical,
tangible way

552
00:35:07.895 --> 00:35:11.396
for me to safely execute
said time heist.

553
00:35:11.398 --> 00:35:13.364
I believe
the most likely outcome

554
00:35:13.366 --> 00:35:14.699
will be our
collective demise.

555
00:35:14.701 --> 00:35:17.434
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

556
00:35:17.436 --> 00:35:20.237
All right? It means no
talking to our past selves...

557
00:35:20.239 --> 00:35:22.007
no betting
on sporting events.

558
00:35:22.009 --> 00:35:23.810
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

559
00:35:24.745 --> 00:35:26.110
Are you seriously
telling me

560
00:35:26.112 --> 00:35:28.078
that your plan
to save the universe...

561
00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.816
is based on
<i>Back to the Future?</i>

562
00:35:30.918 --> 00:35:32.851
- Is it?
- No.

563
00:35:32.853 --> 00:35:33.952
Good. You had me
worried there.

564
00:35:33.954 --> 00:35:35.119
'Cause that would be
horseshit.

565
00:35:35.121 --> 00:35:37.688
That's not how
quantum physics works.

566
00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:38.824
Tony.

567
00:35:40.793 --> 00:35:42.893
We have to take a stand.

568
00:35:42.895 --> 00:35:44.797
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

569
00:35:47.066 --> 00:35:48.899
SCOTT: I know you got
a lot on the line.

570
00:35:48.901 --> 00:35:51.468
You got a wife, a daughter.

571
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:54.204
But I lost someone
very important to me.

572
00:35:54.206 --> 00:35:55.806
A lotta people did.

573
00:35:55.808 --> 00:35:59.142
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

574
00:35:59.144 --> 00:36:00.344
to bring everyone back,

575
00:36:00.346 --> 00:36:02.012
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

576
00:36:02.014 --> 00:36:03.849
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

577
00:36:05.384 --> 00:36:06.951
- I can't.
- (DOOR CLOSES)

578
00:36:06.953 --> 00:36:08.819
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

579
00:36:08.821 --> 00:36:11.555
MORGAN STARK: Mommy told me
to come and save you.

580
00:36:11.557 --> 00:36:14.490
Good job. I'm saved.

581
00:36:14.492 --> 00:36:16.794
I wish you were coming here
to ask me something else.

582
00:36:16.796 --> 00:36:17.795
Anything else.

583
00:36:17.797 --> 00:36:19.863
I'm honestly happy
to see you guys, I just...

584
00:36:19.865 --> 00:36:21.230
Oh, look, the table's
set for six.

585
00:36:21.232 --> 00:36:22.967
Tony. I get it.

586
00:36:22.969 --> 00:36:25.403
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

587
00:36:26.038 --> 00:36:28.204
But this is a second chance.

588
00:36:28.206 --> 00:36:30.874
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

589
00:36:30.876 --> 00:36:32.510
Can't roll the dice on it.

590
00:36:34.379 --> 00:36:36.514
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

591
00:36:39.718 --> 00:36:41.618
Well, he's scared.

592
00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:42.619
STEVE: He's not wrong.

593
00:36:42.621 --> 00:36:44.921
SCOTT: Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

594
00:36:44.923 --> 00:36:46.358
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

595
00:36:47.093 --> 00:36:49.294
No, I wanna do it right.

596
00:36:52.263 --> 00:36:54.198
We're gonna need
a really big brain.

597
00:36:55.066 --> 00:36:56.766
Bigger than his?

598
00:36:56.768 --> 00:36:58.701
Come on, I feel like I'm
the only one eating here.

599
00:36:58.703 --> 00:36:59.802
Try some of that.

600
00:36:59.804 --> 00:37:01.203
Have some eggs.

601
00:37:01.205 --> 00:37:02.572
I'm so confused.

602
00:37:02.574 --> 00:37:04.407
These are confusing times.
(CHUCKLES)

603
00:37:04.409 --> 00:37:06.476
Right, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

604
00:37:06.478 --> 00:37:09.279
Nah, I get it.
I'm kidding!

605
00:37:09.748 --> 00:37:11.714
I know, it's crazy.

606
00:37:11.716 --> 00:37:13.016
I'm wearing shirts now.

607
00:37:13.018 --> 00:37:16.251
Yeah. What? How? Why?

608
00:37:16.253 --> 00:37:19.221
Five years ago,
we got our asses beat.

609
00:37:19.223 --> 00:37:21.057
Except it was worse
for me...

610
00:37:21.059 --> 00:37:22.357
'cause I lost twice.

611
00:37:22.359 --> 00:37:24.395
First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...

612
00:37:25.096 --> 00:37:26.428
and then, we all lost.

613
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:27.964
No one blamed you, Bruce.

614
00:37:27.966 --> 00:37:29.466
I did.

615
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:32.334
For years, I've been
treating the Hulk

616
00:37:32.336 --> 00:37:33.702
like he's some kind
of disease...

617
00:37:33.704 --> 00:37:35.671
something to get rid of.

618
00:37:35.673 --> 00:37:39.075
But then, I start looking
at him as the cure.

619
00:37:39.077 --> 00:37:41.309
Eighteen months
in the gamma lab.

620
00:37:41.311 --> 00:37:44.112
I put the brains
and the brawn together...

621
00:37:44.114 --> 00:37:45.516
and now, look at me.

622
00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.417
Best of both worlds.

623
00:37:48.419 --> 00:37:50.018
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes.

624
00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:51.820
Can we get a photo?

625
00:37:51.822 --> 00:37:53.955
100%, little person.

626
00:37:53.957 --> 00:37:56.558
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

627
00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.627
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- SMART HULK: Thanks.

628
00:37:58.629 --> 00:38:00.227
Say "green."

629
00:38:00.229 --> 00:38:02.698
- FANS: Green.
- Green.

630
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.832
Did you get that?

631
00:38:03.834 --> 00:38:05.667
That's a good one.

632
00:38:05.669 --> 00:38:08.271
Did you want to grab one
with me? I'm Ant-Man.

633
00:38:11.607 --> 00:38:13.607
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

634
00:38:13.609 --> 00:38:14.843
- Nobody does.
- No, he wants you to take

635
00:38:14.845 --> 00:38:16.845
- a picture with him.
- I don't want a picture.

636
00:38:16.847 --> 00:38:17.779
Stranger danger.

637
00:38:17.781 --> 00:38:19.480
Yeah, look, he's even
saying no, he doesn't.

638
00:38:19.482 --> 00:38:20.748
I get it.
I don't want it, either.

639
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:21.917
But come on. The kid...

640
00:38:21.919 --> 00:38:23.384
I don't want a picture
with them.

641
00:38:23.386 --> 00:38:24.585
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.

642
00:38:24.587 --> 00:38:25.786
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

643
00:38:25.788 --> 00:38:27.488
- SCOTT: I don't want to do it.
- We can do it.

644
00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:29.790
- SMART HULK: No, you feel bad.
- Take the goddamn phone.

645
00:38:29.792 --> 00:38:31.026
SMART HULK: Okay.

646
00:38:31.028 --> 00:38:32.426
GIRL: Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

647

what the hell
you're all talking about.

1068

enough Pym Particles

for one round-trip each.

1070
01:02:15.292 --> 01:02:16.325
And these stones have been

1071
01:02:16.327 --> 01:02:18.594
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

1072

Our history.

1073
01:02:19.964 --> 01:02:23.098
So, not a lot of convenient
spots to just drop in, yeah?

1074
01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.136
Which means we have
to pick our targets.

1075
01:02:25.503 --> 01:02:26.904
Correct.

1076
01:02:28.005 --> 01:02:29.804
So, let's start
with the Aether.

1077
01:02:29.806 --> 01:02:31.175
Thor, what do you know?

1078
01:02:36.646 --> 01:02:37.945

1079
01:02:37.947 --> 01:02:40.783
RHODES: No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

1080
01:02:43.653 --> 01:02:45.389
Uh, where to start? Um...

1081
01:02:46.923 --> 01:02:49.924
The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

1082
01:02:49.926 --> 01:02:52.927
Someone called it
a stone before.

1083
01:02:52.929 --> 01:02:57.432
Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

1084
01:02:57.434 --> 01:02:59.200
so someone's gonna need
to amend that

1085
01:02:59.202 --> 01:03:00.701
and stop saying that.

1086
01:03:00.703 --> 01:03:03.472
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.

1087
01:03:03.474 --> 01:03:05.507
My grandfather,
many years ago...

1088
01:03:05.509 --> 01:03:09.611
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

1089
01:03:09.613 --> 01:03:12.146
Ooh. (CHUCKLES)
Scary beings.

1090
01:03:12.148 --> 01:03:13.917
So, Jane, actually...

1091
01:03:14.384 --> 01:03:16.184
Oh, there she is.

1092
01:03:16.186 --> 01:03:20.621
Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.

1093
01:03:20.623 --> 01:03:23.991
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

1094
01:03:23.993 --> 01:03:27.395
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

1095
01:03:27.397 --> 01:03:29.163
and she became
very, very sick.

1096
01:03:29.165 --> 01:03:31.332
And so I had to
take her to Asgard,

1097
01:03:31.334 --> 01:03:32.600
which is where I'm from...

1098
01:03:32.602 --> 01:03:34.701
and we had to try
and fix her.

1099
01:03:34.703 --> 01:03:36.337
We were dating at the time,
you see...

1100
01:03:36.339 --> 01:03:40.042
and I got to introduce her
to my mother...

1101
01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:43.346
(SIGHS) who's dead and, um...

1102
01:03:44.681 --> 01:03:46.180
Oh, you know, Jane and I

1103
01:03:46.182 --> 01:03:48.349
aren't even
dating anymore, so...

1104
01:03:48.351 --> 01:03:49.283
(MOUTHING)

1105
01:03:49.285 --> 01:03:50.685

though. You know?

1106
01:03:50.687 --> 01:03:51.985
Nothing lasts forever.

1107
01:03:51.987 --> 01:03:53.987
- Why don't you come sit down?
- I'm not done yet.

1108
01:03:53.989 --> 01:03:55.690
The only thing
that is permanent in life

1109
01:03:55.692 --> 01:03:57.226
is impermanence. (LAUGHS)

1110

1114
01:04:09.271 --> 01:04:11.171
Quill was a person.

1115
01:04:11.173 --> 01:04:13.773

Remove one of the stones...

So, tell me, Doctor.

1516
01:24:24.030 --> 01:24:26.498
Can your science
prevent all that?

1517
01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:27.501
No...

1518
01:24:28.502 --> 01:24:29.535
but we can erase it.

1519
01:24:29.537 --> 01:24:31.436
Because once we're done
with the stones...

1520
01:24:31.438 --> 01:24:33.906
we can return each one
to its own timeline...

1522

you have to survive.

We will. I will.
I promise.

I can't risk this reality

Strange is meant to be
the best of us.

2573
02:43:06.402 --> 02:43:07.634
you have to return the stones

to the exact moment
you got 'em...

2575

When I had the gauntlet,
the stones,

2581
02:43:21.349 --> 02:43:23.652
I really tried
to bring her back.

2582
02:43:26.688 --> 02:43:28.589
I miss her, man.

You're a good man, Sam.

This one's on me, though.

Don't do anything stupid
till I get back.

2589
02:43:50.579 --> 02:43:51.910
How can I?

2590
02:43:51.912 --> 02:43:53.948
You're taking
all the stupid with you.

2591

Gonna miss you, buddy.

I don't know. He blew
right by his time stamp.

2608

He should be here.

Hi, Sam.

So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?

2616
02:46:00.939 --> 02:46:05.010
Well, after I put the stones
back, I thought...

2617
02:46:06.111 --> 02:46:07.777
maybe...

2618

Only thing
bumming me out...

02:46:29.701 --> 02:46:31.434
is the fact I have
