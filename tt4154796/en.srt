538
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:37,696
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

539
00:34:37,698 --> 00:34:41,168
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

540
00:34:43,003 --> 00:34:44,402
A time heist?

541
00:34:44,404 --> 00:34:46,771
Yeah, a time heist.
Of course.

542
00:34:46,773 --> 00:34:48,073
Why didn't we think
of this before?

543
00:34:48,075 --> 00:34:50,709
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

544
00:34:50,711 --> 00:34:52,911
The stones are in the past.

545
00:34:52,913 --> 00:34:54,312
We could go back,
we could get them.

546
00:34:54,314 --> 00:34:56,681
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

547
00:34:56,683 --> 00:34:58,950
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

548
00:34:58,952 --> 00:35:00,418
I don't believe we would.

549
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,955
Gotta say it. I sometimes
miss that giddy optimism.

550
00:35:03,957 --> 00:35:05,857
However, high hopes
won't help...

551
00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:07,893
if there's no logical,
tangible way

552
00:35:07,895 --> 00:35:11,396
for me to safely execute
said time heist.

553
00:35:11,398 --> 00:35:13,364
I believe
the most likely outcome

554
00:35:13,366 --> 00:35:14,699
will be our
collective demise.

555
00:35:14,701 --> 00:35:17,434
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

556
00:35:17,436 --> 00:35:20,237
All right? It means no
talking to our past selves...

557
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:22,007
no betting
on sporting events.

558
00:35:22,009 --> 00:35:23,810
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

559
00:35:24,745 --> 00:35:26,110
Are you seriously
telling me

560
00:35:26,112 --> 00:35:28,078
that your plan
to save the universe...

561
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,816
is based on
<i>Back to the Future?</i>

562
00:35:30,918 --> 00:35:32,851
- Is it?
- No.

563
00:35:32,853 --> 00:35:33,952
Good. You had me
worried there.

564
00:35:33,954 --> 00:35:35,119
'Cause that would be
horseshit.

565
00:35:35,121 --> 00:35:37,688
That's not how
quantum physics works.

566
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:38,824
Tony.

567
00:35:40,793 --> 00:35:42,893
We have to take a stand.

568
00:35:42,895 --> 00:35:44,797
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

569
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:48,899
SCOTT: I know you got
a lot on the line.

570
00:35:48,901 --> 00:35:51,468
You got a wife, a daughter.

571
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:54,204
But I lost someone
very important to me.

572
00:35:54,206 --> 00:35:55,806
A lotta people did.

573
00:35:55,808 --> 00:35:59,142
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

574
00:35:59,144 --> 00:36:00,344
to bring everyone back,

575
00:36:00,346 --> 00:36:02,012
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

576
00:36:02,014 --> 00:36:03,849
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

577
00:36:05,384 --> 00:36:06,951
- I can't.

00:36:11,557 --> 00:36:14,490
Good job. I'm saved.

00:36:14,492 --> 00:36:16,794
I wish you were coming here

Anything else.

583

I'm honestly happy
to see you guys, I just...

I really am.

But this is a second chance.

588
00:36:28,206 --> 00:36:30,874
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

589
00:36:30,876 --> 00:36:32,510
Can't roll the dice on it.

590
00:36:34,379 --> 00:36:36,514
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

SCOTT: Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

594
00:36:44,923 --> 00:36:46,358
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

595
00:36:47,093 --> 00:36:49,294
No, I wanna do it right.

596
00:36:52,263 --> 00:36:54,198
We're gonna need
a really big brain.

597
00:36:55,066 --> 00:36:56,766
Bigger than his?

598
00:36:56,768 --> 00:36:58,701
Come on, I feel like I'm
the only one eating here.

599
00:36:58,703 --> 00:36:59,802
Try some of that.

600
00:36:59,804 --> 00:37:01,203
Have some eggs.

601
00:37:01,205 --> 00:37:02,572
I'm so confused.

602
00:37:02,574 --> 00:37:04,407
These are confusing times.

603
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:06,476

That's not what I meant.

Nah, I get it.
I'm kidding!

00:37:09,748 --> 00:37:11,714

Yeah. What? How? Why?

608
00:37:16,253 --> 00:37:19,221
Five years ago,
we got our asses beat.

609
00:37:19,223 --> 00:37:21,057
Except it was worse
for me...

610
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:22,357
'cause I lost twice.

611
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:24,395
First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...

612
00:37:25,096 --> 00:37:26,428
and then, we all lost.

613
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,964
No one blamed you, Bruce.

614
00:37:27,966 --> 00:37:29,466
I did.

615
00:37:31,069 --> 00:37:32,334
For years, I've been
treating the Hulk

616
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:33,702
like he's some kind
of disease...

617
00:37:33,704 --> 00:37:35,671
something to get rid of.

618
00:37:35,673 --> 00:37:39,075
But then, I start looking
at him as the cure.

00:37:39,077 --> 00:37:41,309
Eighteen months
in the gamma lab.

620
00:37:41,311 --> 00:37:44,112
I put the brains
and the brawn together...

621
00:37:44,114 --> 00:37:45,516
and now, look at me.

622
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,417
Best of both worlds.

00:37:48,419 --> 00:37:50,018
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes.

00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,820
Can we get a photo?

00:37:51,822 --> 00:37:53,955

That's a good one.

- a picture with him.
- I don't want a picture.

saying no, he doesn't.

I don't want it, either.

01:02:07,685 --> 01:02:08,817
but I don't even know

1067
01:02:08,819 --> 01:02:10,152
what the hell
you're all talking about.

1068
01:02:10,154 --> 01:02:13,322
Regardless, we only have
enough Pym Particles

1069
01:02:13,324 --> 01:02:15,290
for one round-trip each.

1070
01:02:15,292 --> 01:02:16,325
And these stones have been

1071
01:02:16,327 --> 01:02:18,594
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

1072
01:02:18,596 --> 01:02:19,962
Our history.

1073
01:02:19,964 --> 01:02:23,098
So, not a lot of convenient
spots to just drop in, yeah?

1074
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,136
Which means we have
to pick our targets.

1075
01:02:25,503 --> 01:02:26,904
Correct.

1076
01:02:28,005 --> 01:02:29,804
So, let's start
with the Aether.

1077
01:02:29,806 --> 01:02:31,175
Thor, what do you know?

1078
01:02:36,646 --> 01:02:37,945
NATASHA: Is he asleep?

1079
01:02:37,947 --> 01:02:40,783
RHODES: No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

1080
01:02:43,653 --> 01:02:45,389
Uh, where to start? Um...

1081
01:02:46,923 --> 01:02:49,924
The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

1082
01:02:49,926 --> 01:02:52,927
Someone called it
a stone before.

1083
01:02:52,929 --> 01:02:57,432
Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

1084
01:02:57,434 --> 01:02:59,200
so someone's gonna need
to amend that

1085
01:02:59,202 --> 01:03:00,701
and stop saying that.

1086
01:03:00,703 --> 01:03:03,472
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.

1087
01:03:03,474 --> 01:03:05,507
My grandfather,
many years ago...

1088
01:03:05,509 --> 01:03:09,611
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

1089
01:03:09,613 --> 01:03:12,146
Ooh. (CHUCKLES)
Scary beings.

1090
01:03:12,148 --> 01:03:13,917
So, Jane, actually...

1091
01:03:14,384 --> 01:03:16,184
Oh, there she is.

1092
01:03:16,186 --> 01:03:20,621
Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.

1093
01:03:20,623 --> 01:03:23,991
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

1094
01:03:23,993 --> 01:03:27,395
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

1095
01:03:27,397 --> 01:03:29,163
and she became
very, very sick.

1096
01:03:29,165 --> 01:03:31,332
And so I had to
take her to Asgard,

1097
01:03:31,334 --> 01:03:32,600
which is where I'm from...

1098
01:03:32,602 --> 01:03:34,701
and we had to try
and fix her.

1099
01:03:34,703 --> 01:03:36,337
We were dating at the time,
you see...

1100
01:03:36,339 --> 01:03:40,042
and I got to introduce her
to my mother...

1101
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:43,346
(SIGHS) who's dead and, um...

1102
01:03:44,681 --> 01:03:46,180
Oh, you know, Jane and I

1103
01:03:46,182 --> 01:03:48,349
aren't even
dating anymore, so...

1104
01:03:48,351 --> 01:03:49,283
(MOUTHING)

1105
01:03:49,285 --> 01:03:50,685
Yes, these things happen,
though. You know?

1106
01:03:50,687 --> 01:03:51,985
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

1107
01:03:51,987 --> 01:03:53,987
- Why don't you come sit down?
- I'm not done yet.

1108
01:03:53,989 --> 01:03:55,690
The only thing
that is permanent in life

1109
01:03:55,692 --> 01:03:57,226
is impermanence. (LAUGHS)

1110
01:03:57,826 --> 01:04:00,393
Awesome.
Eggs? Breakfast?

1111
01:04:00,395 --> 01:04:02,362
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

1112
01:04:02,364 --> 01:04:05,533
ROCKET: Quill said he stole
the Power Stone from Morag.

1113
01:04:05,535 --> 01:04:08,503
- SMART HULK: Is that a person?
- No, Morag's a planet.

1114
01:04:09,271 --> 01:04:11,171
Quill was a person.

1115
01:04:11,173 --> 01:04:13,773
Like a planet?
Like in outer space?

1116
01:04:13,775 --> 01:04:15,175
Oh, look.

1117
01:04:15,177 --> 01:04:18,078

all happy and everything.

the Soul Stone on Vormir.

What is Vormir?

1122
01:04:28,123 --> 01:04:30,023

of celestial existence.

murdered my sister.

Mm... Bleecker Street.

01:04:57,451 --> 01:04:58,984
Wait, he lived
in New York?

1134

one shot.

<i>Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.</i>

1149

<i>You know your teams.
You know your missions.</i>

1150

Get them back.</i>

we should know what to expect.

suck out the Infinity Stone...

01:47:10,472 --> 01:47:12,808
Did you see what happens
in the future?

1929
01:47:14,043 --> 01:47:16,545
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1930
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:19,982
You wanna know
how he does that?

1931
01:47:21,283 --> 01:47:25,621
You wanna know
what he does to you?

1932
01:47:26,021 --> 01:47:27,420
That's enough.

You disgust me.

But that doesn't mean
you're useless.

1937
01:48:09,131 --> 01:48:10,898
How do I look?

1938
01:48:17,572 --> 01:48:18,573
Wow.

1939
01:48:19,373 --> 01:48:22,608
Under different
circumstances...

1940
01:48:22,610 --> 01:48:24,812
this would be
totally awesome.

1943
01:48:39,727 --> 01:48:41,727
Technically he's not
a raccoon, you know?

1944
01:48:41,729 --> 01:48:43,561
Oh, whatever.
He eats garbage.

In order to take
the stone...

1964

you must lose
that which you love.

this shit up.

No.

1971
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:22,726
I don't think so.

1972
01:50:22,728 --> 01:50:25,064
Why? 'Cause he knows
your daddy's name?

1973
01:50:26,464 --> 01:50:27,700
I didn't.

1974
01:50:28,901 --> 01:50:31,603
Thanos left here
with the stone...

1975
01:50:32,137 --> 01:50:33,704
without his daughter.

1976
01:50:33,706 --> 01:50:35,975

Yeah.

1983
01:51:00,099 --> 01:51:02,600
Then I guess we both know
who it's gotta be.

1984
01:51:03,202 --> 01:51:04,535
I guess we do.

1985
01:51:12,677 --> 01:51:14,478
I'm starting to think

1986
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:17,847
we mean different
people here, Natasha.

1987
01:51:17,849 --> 01:51:20,049
For the last five years,
I've been trying to do one thing.

Get to right here.

1989

Bringing everybody back.

No, don't you get
all decent on me now.

I wanna do it?

want you to. How's that?

what I've done.

Why are we acting
like she's dead?

We have the stones, right?

the stones...

Look, I'm sorry,
no offense,

but you're a very
earthly being, okay?

And we're talking
about space magic.

We haven't decided
who's gonna put that on yet.

I'm sorry. What, we're all
just sitting around

2073
01:58:12,022 --> 01:58:13,355
waiting for
the right opportunity?

2074
01:58:13,357 --> 01:58:14,790
We should at least
discuss it.

2075
01:58:14,792 --> 01:58:16,825
Look, sitting here
staring at the thing

2076
01:58:16,827 --> 01:58:18,662
is not gonna bring
everybody back.

2077
01:58:19,696 --> 01:58:21,163
I'm the strongest Avenger,
okay?

2078
01:58:21,165 --> 01:58:22,764
So, this responsibility
falls upon me.

- It's my duty.

- It's not about that.
- It's not that. (SHUSHES)

- Stop it! Just let me.

01:58:30,874 --> 01:58:32,407
Just let me do it.

01:58:32,409 --> 01:58:35,142
Just let me do something good.
Something right.

2084
01:58:35,144 --> 01:58:36,344
Look, it's not
just the fact...

2085
01:58:36,346 --> 01:58:37,646
that that glove is channeling
enough energy

2086
01:58:37,648 --> 01:58:38,580
to light up a continent.

2087
01:58:38,582 --> 01:58:40,649
I'm telling you.
You're in no condition.

You saw what those
stones did to Thanos.

2095
01:58:57,099 --> 01:58:58,735
They almost killed him.
